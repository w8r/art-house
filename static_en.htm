              <p>Loft apartments first appeared in New York during the Great Depression.
              As multiple industrial companies went out of business they left behind
              large numbers of unused industrial structures in downtown areas of the city.
              However, these buildings did not remain unoccupied for long; rented out for
              throw-away prices they very quickly became favourites with young aspiring
              and usually rather poor artists, actors, musicians and practitioners of
              other art forms who used them not just as shared lodgings but as venues for
              their experimental projects. Shops and industrial sites were converted into
              living quarters that also included elements of artist studios or theatre
              stages. The new loft apartments became the venues for art exhibitions
              and concerts, and the birth places of new cultural movements and artistic
              alliances. Two decades later loft apartments made their debut in Europe.</p>
              <p>A mandatory feature of a loft apartment is a huge floor area of hundreds
              of square metres with no partitions, extremely high ceilings, and huge windows.
              It can have two levels along one wall with a staircase leading to the upper
              level which will house the host’s bedroom and office. A primary goal of a loft
              apartment is to merge life and work into one; doing creative arts is not really
              a job, it’s just a way of life. Another characteristic is the conspicuous display
              of the industrial origin of the place, such things as ventilation ducts along the
              walls, metal staircases with perforated steps, wrought iron slabs, exposed brick
              of the walls are all a must. A former industrial shop is an ideal venue for a
              modern art gallery. One example is London’s Tate Modern gallery housed in the massive
              building of a former power plant on the bank of the Thames.</p>
              <p>Loft apartments are a fashion that became a trend. Once grim industrial zones
              were first gentrified by artists and then evolved into trendy neighbourhoods with
              modern galleries, theatres, art lounges, in other words with a rich artistic history.
               Lofts are not simply a type of accommodation; to people living in them they are a
               way to make a statement either about their denial of the traditional bourgeois
               living values or about their involvement with modern art. That is clearly the
               intended message of Manhattan’s Meatpacking’s, Amsterdam’s Jordaan, LA’s Arts
               District or London’s Docklands.</p>
              <p>Such neighbourhoods are already emerging in Moscow. One of the most impressive
              and ambitious projects is being implemented by State Development. It is the
              construction of the Art House residential complex in Tessinsky lane, a project
              that has already received a number of awards including Àðõnews and the Arch-Moscow prize.</p>

              <p>The buildings comprising the &quot;Art House complex&quot; are connected with each
              other by a promenade paved with the same special order clinker bricks that the structures
              themselves are made of. In contrast to the majority of the traditional houses for the
              well-off found across today’s Russia, the ones in the Art House will not have either
              brick walls or high fences around them. These buildings are not made to keep a low profile
              or to fit in perfectly with the local environment, neither are they hidden from the
              neighbours. Absolutely open for viewing by passers-by, the buildings totally lack the
              grim nova riche wariness of the outside world.</p>
              <p>Open without chumminess and with their own unique style, these new buildings
              represent a phenomenon that has so far been absent in Moscow: enlightened, tolerant,
              inbred aristocratism.</p>

              <p>Tessinsky lane is not yet as well known as the Golden Mile, Plyushchikha or Arbat.
              Its full potential is yet to be fully realised, even though it is located only about
              fifteen hundred metres from the Kremlin and in the direct vicinity of several important
              transportation hubs. Recently the area between Lefortovo and Kitai-gorod has fast been
              turning into an artistic, bohemian stretch as more and more art galleries, studios,

              <p>The people at State Development are sure that the construction of the &quot;Art House&quot;

            <p>Beyond Serebryanichesky lane is found another lane called Tessinsky. It is named after the collegiate assessor A. I. von Tessin who once lived there. The daughter of this Russian Swede, Emilia Andreevna, married Nikolay Ostrovsky, the farther of the famous Russian playwright Alexander Ostrovsky, who in turn bought a large plot of land from Tessin’s sons in 1840. That plot was located at the top of the hill in the place currently occupied by buildings 5, 7 and 9 in Nikolovorobyinsky lane which is the street that goes up a steep rise off to the left of Serebryanichesky lane. Initially A. Ostrovsky lived in the main house (building No 7) but in the second half of 1849 he moved with his common law spouse Agafia Ivanovna into the small wooden house opposite Serebryanichesky lane. It was in this little house that A. Ostrovsky wrote his first work of prose, How a Non-Commissioned Police Officer Broke into a Dance or There is only One Step from Greatness to Absurdity as well as such milestone works as the Storm, Made Men will Make it Up, A Lucrative Place, Lucky Breaks Don’t Last Forever, Don’t Get into Someone Else’s Sleigh, Poverty is not a Vice and a number of others. It was also from this house that he would go to work at the Conscience and Business Courts as well as to visit the chief editor of the Muscovite magazine, Pogodin on Virgin field where he worked as an editor and an author of short articles. At this house he was also visited by famous writers (Dostoevsky, Goncharov, Turgenev, Grigorovich, Pisemsky), actors (Turchaninov, Prov Sadovsky, Kositskaya-Nikulina), musicians and composers. Looking back at that period of his life, Ostrovsky later wrote, ‘The Vorobinsky house was a perfect place for catching a cold and a really lousy place for writing or even thinking; the house didn’t have a single quiet place in which either could be done without interference.’ This house witnessed the deaths of the playwright’s four children and first wife. The year she died, 1867, was when the estate began to be gradually sold off and built over with new style buildings.</p>
            <a rel="lightbox[history]" href="img/lrg/snapshot20071118225612.jpg"><img src="img/thumbs/p02fp0201.jpg" alt="enlarge" /></a>
            <p>In 1869 A. Ostrovsky married actress M. Vasilyeva. The newlyweds together with the author’s six children soon moved to S. Golitsin’s house on Volkhonka. The playwright’s old house was at first used as a bar and then, in the late 19th century, it was torn down, its place being taken over by the new Tessinsky lane. The windows of Ostrovsky’s house looked out directly onto the Serebryanicheskye bathhouses.</p>
            <p>Today, house 14 on Serebryanichesky lane, which was formerly owned by the nearby plant, is home to the Prestige private school. Not far away there is another educational facility, the so called Traditional classical school (Tessinsky lane 4). Once it was a day care centre, then it was damaged by a fire and stood empty for about a decade and finally in the mid 1990’s the building was restored and sanctified and today the domes of this orthodox school once again shine over the neighbourhood.</p>
            <p>The tall red brick building on the corner of Tessinsky and Nikolovorobyinsky lanes belongs to the Moscow plant of electronic medical equipment.</p>

            <h3>The studio design by Sergey Skuratov</h3>
            <p>ought to be called neo-loft as it is not a real loft in the classical sense of the word, since rather than being converted from an industrial structure it is designed and built as such from scratch and is thus an imitation. However, a neo-loft has at least two undisputable advantages: first, the designers are absolutely free in their choice of architectural solutions and second, the future owners of the loft apartment can be sure the building is one hundred percent environmentally friendly as it has never been used as either a production shop or a warehouse.</p>
            <p>Sergey Skuratov chose clinker brick as the main construction and decoration material because he believes it best fits the 'Moscow' style. Nevertheless, the clinker bricks that will be used in the project are made in Germany where only one of the preliminarily selected 10 plants was able to guarantee conformance to all the requirements including the colour. The colours of the buildings are somewhat different from each other; the smaller one in the back will be a combination of brown and gray. The other building will be lighter, with a prevalence of gray terra-cotta with dots of brown.</p>
            <p>Absolutely open for viewing by passers-by, the buildings totally lack the grim nova riche wariness of the outside world.</p>
            <p>The architect made the buildings look like factories by playing around with the stereotypical ideas about what an industrial building should look like. The windows create the impression that there is no floor inside, in some places they angle towards each other linking up at the tips, but primarily they merge forming intricate vertical garlands. The wall of one of the two buildings leans slightly; the roofs on both buildings follow suit by being tilted and shifted. ‘These are two mental houses,’ the author jokes.</p>
            <p>The two Art House buildings offer a total of 30 apartments, 12 in building A and 18 in building B. The floor areas of the apartments range from 80 to 250 square metres. The ceiling height conforms to the standards of a loft apartment, ranging from 3.8 to 5.1 metres in the standard apartments and from 9.0 to 10.3 metres in the penthouses. The ground floors will house an art gallery, a restaurant, possibly art studies. The complex has quite an impressive underground parking garage for 109 vehicles.</p>

           <p>We always do our best in designing buildings that have a story to tell, and thus may become a monument to future generations. Arthouse is undoubtedly one of such projects.</p>
           <p>When we started a project of an estate at Tessinsky Side Street, our first decision was to increase the ceiling height. While imagining how the buildings will be set among the surrounding we found out that the project should acquire loft aesthetics. But as we had no old structure in the area to work with, it became obvious that a loft should be built initially. This is how Arthouse became a neoloft.</p>
           <p>A loft, with its high ceilings and extra light is fits perfectly for exhibiting purposes. It became obvious at one point that a gallery will find home in one of the buildings, so this is how the name of the residence, Arthouse, was born. Arthouse is targeted at very specific people of art, if not by profession, then by their spirit of freedom and philosophy. We created such an outstanding space, that a non-creative person may simply not understand the concept in whole.</p>
           <p>It was vital to find an architect that could carry out this concept brilliantly. In one of his interviews Sergey Skuratov says that the most challenging tasks are his favorite ones. So we offered him just what he liked. In just a month our idea was converted into an outstanding project, ready to put to life in the centre of Moscow.</p>
           <p>Even at the stage of designing, while being an architectural project, Arthouse acclaimed several important awards, including "Best Project" at ArchMoscow and a diploma for "Bringing the Poetry into Architecture" at Arch Awards.</p>
